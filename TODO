#summary A list of TODOs for the project.

 * Move tests into test directory & break tests out into functional areas.  Annotate all tests with basic, intermediate, advanced, or alien-tech, and add support for this to features.py & reports.py.  For basic metadata such as "what does this db call a CLOB type," find a better solution than using `SupportedFeatures` -- these kinds of things are currently mudding up the feature system.

 * Figure out how to handle testing of multiple DB-API versions, (& multiple driver versions, too).

 * Add support for as many drivers as we reasonably can. Survey these drivers for common feature sets as we go. 

 * Clean up report.py so that it directly creates the wiki pages (currently using a hybrid of auto-generated & manual editing).  Also should create wrapper functions for creating tables so it'll be easier to change wiki engines -- google code's wiki isn't very feature rich.

 * Create a build-bot to run tests on change in either acute-dbapi or drivers under test.

 * Once all of the above are complete, ask db-sig to vote on tests that should be moved to another conformance level.
