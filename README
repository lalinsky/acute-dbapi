Here's a little humour from the original discussion of creating a DBAPI test suite:

 "Now we have booze and barflies entering the discussion, plus rumours of
  DBAs on drugs... and I won't tell you what flashes through my mind each
  time I read the subject line with 'Anal Compliance' in it.  All around
  this is turning out to be a thoroughly unwholesome unit test."
