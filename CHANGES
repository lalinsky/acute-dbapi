 Revision 1.4  2003/02/15 00:16:33  zenzen
 Changes, as per suggestions and bug reports by M.-A. Lemburg,
 Matthew T. Kromer, Federico Di Gregorio and Daniel Dittmar
 - Class renamed
 - Now a subclass of TestCase, to avoid requiring the driver stub
   to use multiple inheritance
 - Reversed the polarity of buggy test in test_description
 - Test exception heirarchy correctly
 - self.populate is now self._populate(), so if a driver stub
   overrides self.ddl1 this change propogates
 - VARCHAR columns now have a width, which will hopefully make the
   DDL even more portible (this will be reversed if it causes more problems)
 - cursor.rowcount being checked after various execute and fetchXXX methods
 - Check for fetchall and fetchmany returning empty lists after results
   are exhausted (already checking for empty lists if select retrieved
   nothing
 - Fix bugs in test_setoutputsize_basic and test_setinputsizes
